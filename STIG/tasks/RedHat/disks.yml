       Description:
          RHEL 8 systems handling data requiring "data at rest" protections must employ cryptographic
          mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of the information at rest.

          Selection of a cryptographic mechanism is based on the need to protect the integrity of
          organizational information. The strength of the mechanism is commensurate with the security category
          and/or classification of the information. Organizations have the flexibility to either encrypt all
          information on storage devices (i.e., full disk encryption) or encrypt specific data structures
          (e.g., files, records, or fields).

          Satisfies: SRG-OS-000185-GPOS-00079, SRG-OS-000404-GPOS-00183, SRG-OS-000405-GPOS-00184
        Check:
          Verify RHEL 8 prevents unauthorized disclosure or modification of all information requiring at-rest
          protection by using disk encryption.

          If there is a documented and approved reason for not having data-at-rest encryption, this
          requirement is Not Applicable.

          Verify all system partitions are encrypted with the following command:

          $ sudo blkid

          /dev/mapper/rhel-root:  UUID="67b7d7fe-de60-6fd0-befb-e6748cf97743" TYPE="crypto_LUKS"

          Every persistent disk partition present must be of type "crypto_LUKS". If any partitions other than
          the boot partition or pseudo file systems (such as /proc or /sys) are not type "crypto_LUKS", ask
          the administrator to indicate how the partitions are encrypted.  If there is no evidence that these
          partitions are encrypted, this is a finding.
        Fix:
          Configure RHEL 8 to prevent unauthorized modification of all information at rest by using disk
          encryption.

          Encrypting a partition in an already installed system is more difficult, because existing partitions
          will need to be resized and changed. To encrypt an entire partition, dedicate a partition for
          encryption in the partition layout.

        Check:

          $ sudo grep /var/log/audit /etc/fstab

          UUID=3645951a /var/log/audit xfs defaults 1 2

          If an entry for "/var/log/audit" does not exist, ask the System Administrator if the system audit
          logs are being written to a different file system/partition on the system, then grep for that file
          system/partition.

          If a separate file system/partition does not exist for the system audit data path, this is a
          finding.
        Fix:
          Migrate the system audit data path onto a separate file system.

        Check:
          Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for non-privileged local interactive
          user home directories.

          Check the home directory assignment for all non-privileged users, users with a User Identifier (UID)
          greater than 1000, on the system with the following command:

          $ sudo awk -F: '($3>=1000)&&($7 !~ /nologin/){print $1,$3,$6}' /etc/passwd

          adamsj 1001 /home/adamsj
          jacksonm 1002 /home/jacksonm
          smithj 1003 /home/smithj

          The output of the command will give the directory/partition that contains the home directories for
          the non-privileged users on the system (in this example, "/home") and usersâ€™ shell. All accounts
          with a valid shell (such as /bin/bash) are considered interactive users.

          Check that a file system/partition has been created for the non-privileged interactive users with
          the following command:

          Note: The partition of "/home" is used in the example.

          $ sudo grep /home /etc/fstab

          UUID=333ada18 /home ext4 noatime,nobarrier,nodev 1 2

          If a separate entry for the file system/partition containing the non-privileged interactive user
          home directories does not exist, this is a finding.
        Fix:
          Migrate the "/home" directory onto a separate file system/partition.
